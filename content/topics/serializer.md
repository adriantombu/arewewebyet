intro = "Serializers allow you to easily transfer states and reliably get it back â€“ important not only when working with JSON but also backbone of many types of worker-queue systems. Many of these crates are built on top of [Serde](https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/serializer/#pkg-serde), the awesome serialization framework for Rust."
